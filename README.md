# Project-3-EV-Dataset-Analysis-using-Python
Project Overview: Vehicle Registration Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I analyzed the Electric Vehicle Registration Data to gain insights into vehicle registration trends, and model popularity, and to create visually appealing, interactive dashboards to showcase the findings.
üîç Key Objectives:
Analyze the number of vehicle registrations by make and model.
Identify top models based on vehicle registrations.
Visualize the hierarchical relationships between vehicle makes and models using interactive Treemaps.
Create detailed visualizations to support data-driven decisions.
üîß Skills and Tools Used:
Python: Primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
Numpy: For numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for traditional visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
Plotly: Created interactive visualizations such as Treemaps to display vehicle registration trends by model, offering dynamic hover-over details for a more engaging user experience.
üìä Visualization Highlights:
Treemaps: I created an interactive Treemap to visualize vehicle registrations by make and model, making it easy to understand the relative size of each model's registration numbers.
Bar Charts and Heatmaps: Visualized registration trends across regions and explored correlations using heatmaps and bar charts.
Custom Dashboards: Enhanced the insights with a range of visual tools to make the data more accessible for both technical and non-technical audiences.
üìà Results and Insights:
Identified top-performing vehicle models with the highest number of registrations.
Uncovered regional trends in electric vehicle registrations.
Gained valuable insights into the market share of various makes and models, assisting in business decisions for stakeholders.
This project provided a deeper understanding of how effective visualizations can uncover hidden trends in complex datasets and assist in data-driven decision-making.
